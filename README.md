Created a deliveroo food delivery clone implemented in react-native. Both frontend and backeend are implemented in this repository
To start the front end application use expo to run the app on your simulator or device.
To start the backend of the application go to the backend folder and run the node js index.js script which uses express

Note: The backend and frontend use 2 different node modules, you would have to install them seperately
